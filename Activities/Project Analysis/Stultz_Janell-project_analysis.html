	<h3>Site Intent</h3>	
	<p>Kingdom Multisport is a triathlon coaching business, which offers varying degrees 
	coaching for a range of monthly fees.  There are many triathlon-coaching businesses 
	that can be accessed across the nation.  No one business necessarily dominates a 
	particular region since there are not actual facilities that have to be accessed.  
	Kingdom Multisport has branded itself as affordable, quality coaching geared mostly at 
	beginners, although current clients have completed a broad range of race distances.  
	The coaches have a “family first” approach and focus on building plans that work for 
	each athlete rather than the athlete following a “cookie cutter” plan that gets sold 
	to everyone.  Competition comes from the certification level of the coaches and how 
	aggressive of a training plan is being sought.  The primary goal of the site in general 
	is to produce paying clients for this business.</p>

	<p>Most of Kingdom Multisport’s business comes from word of mouth and referrals from 
	current athletes, however a more professional website shows validity as these referrals 
	do consult the site for pricing information as well as more information regarding the 
	three coaches.  An increase in web traffic would also be welcomed though.</p>  

	<p>Currently, this site does not offer any pricing or coaching plans for a potential 
	client to view.  Adding this information could possibly keep the attention of a user 
	a bit longer.</p>

	<div id="goals"><h4><strong>Goals for Redesign:</strong></h4></div>
		<ul class="goals">
			<li>Streamlining current content: navigation menu buttons are labeled, however, 
			the content needs to flow better on each page and not be so chopped up.</li>
			<li>Creating easier navigation by using “back” buttons: most navigation pages 
			have only one page of information without links.  The “Coaches” tab allows for
			the user to read a short bio of each of the three coaches but does not allow 
			the user to go “back” without going back to the “Coaches” tab.  Adding “back” 
			buttons will allow the user to shuffle through these links more easily.</li>
			<li>Adding possible “packages” and price ranges for potential clients to view: 
			this information is currently lacking on the site.</li>
			<li>Correcting HTML and CSS errors to validate properly: currently there are 
			9 markup and 9 CSS errors according to W3C’s online validator tool.</li>
			<li>Transform the site to be responsive so it is better viewed on smaller 
			mobile devices, such as phones since so many potential clients are “on the go": 
			the site currently does not scale and has virtually no mobile access capability.</li>

	<p>These competitor websites offer more polished, professional aesthetics that the 
	client is looking for, through the use typeface, organization, navigation, and color 
	pallet.  Although a small percentage of the overall usage right now is through a mobile 
	device, being able to access Kingdom Multisport on the go through a responsive design 
	will be an added benefit in the future for clients.</p>
	
	<h3>Targeted Audience</h3>
	<p>Kingdom Multisport’s targeted audience, or clientele, is not so much pointed to 
	specific age, gender, or profession, but to varying level of triathlon understanding 
	and fitness.  The extremes would range from the absolute new beginner who needs to be taught the very 
	basics of the sport and how to train, to the accomplished triathlete who is looking to 
	increase their level of competitiveness and understands the value in having a coach who 
	will build a program to propel them to a more elite status.  The majority of the current 
	client list falls mostly in the middle of these two extremes.</p>
