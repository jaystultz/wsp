	<p>I know what it is to be the Triathlon Age-Grouper and balance life with triathlon 
	training. I’m a husband, father of 3, work full time as an Operations Manager, a student, 
	and am involved with Multisport Ministries Triathlon team. My passion is Triathlon; 
	constantly pushing myself to improve while passionately working hard to achieve greatness 
	with the athletes I coach.</p>

	<p>I wasn’t always healthy. I used to be 100 lbs overweight and started running in 
	combination with proper diet as a means to get fit. Once I got to my ideal weight I began 
	to compete in sprint distance triathlons and marathon/half marathon races ultimately 
	working my way to completing the Ironman. I know what it takes to lose the weight and to 
	train and prepare for your big race and welcome discussing what your fitness and lifestyle 
	goals are.</p>

	<p>I got into the sport of triathlon about 12 years ago with the goal of completing an 
	Ironman Distance triathlon. Here I am, 12 years later and I have completed four full distance 
	Ironman’s along with many other sprint to half distance events. Over the past few years 
	I have been coaching and helping others meet goals they have within the sport. My wife and 
	2 kids (both girls, 9 and 11) are also involved in the sport of triathlon and have competed 
	in events at various distances.</p>

	<p>Triathlon has become a lifestyle that I live. I love sharing the knowledge that I have
	learned over the past 12 years and helping others reach their goals whether it is finishing 
	their first sprint to completing an Iron-distance event. I currently serve as a full-time 
	student pastor in Wilson, NC. I am also the chaplain for the NC-chapter of Multisport Ministries 
	and race with the team throughout the year at various events.</p>

	<p>It was the middle of 2005 and as usual I was sitting on my couch. I was lethargic 
	all the time, and just looked forward to the next nap I could take. Frustrated with my 
	general condition, I decided to sign-up for a triathlon as a way of getting into shape. 
	Woefully unprepared and in way over my head, I completed that first sprint triathlon 
	in Clemson, SC near the back of the pack in the "Novice" category. I was, however, 
	amazingly proud and completely hooked on the sport of triathlon!</p>

	<p>Since that day in South Carolina, the Lord has blessed me with some amazing experiences. 
	In addition to some great venues ad events, more than anything, the people that He has 
	put in my path to help me along the way has led to lasting friendships and personal 
	relationships that I cherish. From shop-owners to vendors, athletes to spectators, the 
	camaraderie in this sporting community is truly life changing.</p>
	
	<p>I believe that training and racing as a part of an active lifestyle adds benefit to 
	every aspect of life. Personally, I am a full time senior technologist for a very large 
	financial institution. Having a full time job myself, I understand the need to balance 
	God, family, work, and other activities in life. It is this sense of balance that I want 
	to bring to the athletes I coach. For the age-grouper - this is a hobby. We do not make 
	money doing this, and, we want to enjoy every minute. Helping my athletes get prepared 
	for raceday, while working in the time needed to effectively train, is a task that I 
	look forward to everyday.</p>
	
	<p>I have been blessed to work with some of the best coaches in the world: from Olympic 
	coaches, to USAT National U23 coaches, to nutritionists who plan for some of the top pros. 
	I want to take the experience I have gained during my time in this sport and share them with 
	our athletes as they reach for goals they never dreamed possible!</p>
